# E-Commerce Product Filter and Sort Component

This is a React-based project designed to showcase a product listing page with filtering, sorting, and animations. The component includes features like filtering products by category, sorting them by price, and displaying the products in a responsive grid. It also provides smooth animations for various actions such as hover effects, adding products to the cart, and lazy loading of product images.

### Features:

1. **Product Listing Grid**:
   - Products are displayed in a responsive grid layout that adjusts to screen sizes.
   - Each product card contains:
     - Product image
     - Product name
     - Product price
     - An "Add to Cart" button

2. **Animations**:
   - **Hover Effect**: A subtle scale-up animation with a shadow effect is applied when the user hovers over a product card.
   - **Loading Animation**: When the page loads, a skeleton or spinner loader is displayed to indicate loading content.
   - **Add to Cart**: The "Add to Cart" button has a ripple effect on click and a cart icon animation that appears when an item is added to the cart.
   - **Filter/Sort Animation**: The transition of the filter and sorting options is animated to make it smooth when the user selects options.
   - **Lazy Loading**: Product images use a fade-in effect to appear smoothly as they load.

3. **Filters and Sorting**:
   - A filter bar is provided with various options:
     - **Category**: Allows the user to filter products by predefined categories such as Electronics, Fashion, Accessories, etc.
     - **Price Range**: Filters the products based on price.
   - Sorting options like "Price: Low to High" and "Price: High to Low" allow the user to reorder the products accordingly.

4. **Cart Notification**:
   - A **Toastify** notification is displayed when a product is added to the cart, with a floating animation for visual feedback. This helps users know that their action was successful. The notification provides a smooth and non-intrusive way to inform users about their cart updates.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - The design adapts well to mobile, tablet, and desktop views, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.
